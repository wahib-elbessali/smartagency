"""Deployable surface over engine.py, mounted at /weapon by the unified app in
main.py. Continuous, always-on weapon detection across whatever cameras are
registered -- no zones/floor-position concept (unlike features/zoning), no
per-event trigger (unlike face_recognition's /scan): this is meant to always be
watching every registered camera and alert the instant a weapon-class appears in
ANY of them, using features/common/live_alert_service.py (shared with fire, emotion and
wanted detection).

- POST      /weapon/sources         -- {"sources": {cam: url_or_path, ...}} merges
                                        into the camera registry (accumulates
                                        across calls, same convention as zoning's
                                        POST /zones `sources` field). Once >=1
                                        source exists, detection runs continuously
                                        in the background.
- GET       /weapon/sources          -- current camera registry.
- DELETE    /weapon/sources/{camera} -- stop watching one camera.
- WebSocket /weapon/alerts/stream    -- live per-camera detections, pushed only
                                        when the SET OF DETECTED CLASSES for a
                                        camera changes (see
                                        features/common/live_alert_service.py for why --
                                        confidence-score jitter alone must not
                                        trigger a push).

Frame preview is not duplicated here: the unified app serves one GET /frame and
GET /video_meta for every feature, since they were six byte-identical copies.

Tunables live in features/config.json under "weapon": conf (0.25), imgsz
(640), update_interval (seconds between detection cycles, 2.0).
