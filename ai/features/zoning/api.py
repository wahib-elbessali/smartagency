"""Deployable surface over zones.py. A real frontend owns the interactive
part (showing a camera image, letting someone click polygon corners --
reference_ui/zoning/zone_app.py is a reference implementation of that
interaction, not the deployed one); this API only ever receives a COMPLETE
polygon per call.

Mounted at /zoning by the unified app in features/main.py.

- GET       /zoning/zones    -- every current zone (mode/camera/polygon).
- POST      /zoning/zones     -- {"name", "camera", "polygon": [[px,py],...],
                                  "sources": {cam: url_or_path, ...}} (>=3
                                  polygon points). `camera` is the camera the
                                  polygon was DRAWN on and must be one of
                                  `sources`. The zone's MODE is inferred from
                                  how many cameras `sources` carries: one ->
                                  pixel zone (that camera's own detections, no
                                  calibration needed), two or more -> world
                                  zone (converted to floor metres via
                                  `camera`'s calibration, counted against
                                  features/person_tracking's LIVE tracked
                                  positions -- see the route docstring and
                                  _world_positions() below). `sources` is
                                  also how this deployment learns where to
                                  pull a PIXEL camera's live feed from
                                  (calibration only gives pixel<->floor math,
                                  never a feed address) -- merged into the
                                  site-wide camera registry, keyed by camera
                                  id, so it accumulates across every zone
                                  ever created, not just this one. A world
                                  zone's own cameras are registered here too
                                  (for the `camera`/Hinv lookup and response
                                  bookkeeping) but this module no longer
                                  reads live frames for them itself -- only
                                  cameras referenced by a PIXEL zone are ever
                                  actually read, see _run_pixel_cycle().
- DELETE    /zoning/zones/{name}      -- removes one zone entirely.
- WebSocket /zoning/occupancy/stream  -- live per-zone occupancy, pushed only when
                                  a zone's count actually CHANGES, OR (world
                                  zones only) when /people's running-ness
                                  changes -- not a fixed heartbeat. Optional
                                  `?threshold=N` query param: only bother this
                                  connection once a zone's count is >= N
                                  (still tells it when a zone drops back
                                  below, so its view never goes stale). See
                                  the docstring on that route.

The frontend gets its clickable camera image from the app-level GET /frame and
GET /video_meta, shared by every feature rather than duplicated here.

WORLD-MODE ZONES ARE COUPLED TO /people, NOT INDEPENDENTLY DETECTED. This
module used to run its own second person-detector + nearest-position fusion
(fuse_camera_boxes) for world zones -- two independent person-detection
pipelines watching the same cameras, pure redundant compute, and this
module's own fusion was strictly weaker than /people's POM-based one anyway
(real silhouette+foot evidence, a duplicate guard, identity-aware revival).
A world-mode zone now REQUIRES features/person_tracking to be `running`
(POST /people/sources with the same camera(s), confirm via GET
/people/status) -- if it isn't, the zone counts 0 but the occupancy stream's
`people_tracking_ready: false` field says so explicitly, rather than that 0
being silently indistinguishable from "genuinely empty" (see
_world_positions()'s docstring). PIXEL-mode zones are completely unaffected
-- no calibration, no /people dependency, this module still runs its own
lightweight single-camera detection for those.

Detection runs CONTINUOUSLY in the background once at least one zone exists
-- there is no on-demand "give me occupancy right now" endpoint anymore (an
earlier version had a blocking POST /occupancy; replaced entirely by the
WebSocket, per the same "one way to do a job" reasoning used everywhere else
in this project -- a backend just connects to the stream and gets pushed
updates, or doesn't connect and the detection loop runs regardless).
Tunables live in features/config.json under "zoning": weights, imgsz, conf,
update_interval (default 2.0s -- responsive enough for a live queue display
without pinning the CPU continuously on the Pi 4 deployment target; `fuse_dist`
and `min_cameras` were removed from here when world-mode zones stopped doing
their own fusion -- see features/person_tracking's own tunables for the
equivalent knobs on the pipeline that now does that work). Zones and
calibration are read from and written to features/data/, a fixed location --
see paths.py.

    for a world zone it reflects whether features/person_tracking is
    currently `running` -- `false` means this zone's `count: 0` means
    "/people isn't tracking yet", NOT "genuinely empty", and pushing on that
    transition (not just on count) is what keeps the two distinguishable
    instead of both looking like a silent, unexplained zero. `?threshold=3`

    in a zone" -- but you'll still get told when it drops back below, so
    your last-known state never goes stale. The backend can connect,
