"""The single deployed API. One process, one port, every feature.

    uvicorn features.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Lives in features/ rather than at the repo root because everything deployed
lives under features/ -- the root holds research/tooling (architectures/,
evaluation/, experiments/, reference_ui/), which is not shipped. Named main.py
rather than api.py so the name `api.py` stays reserved for a single feature's
endpoint module; this file composes them rather than defining any of its own.

Each feature still owns its own file pair under features/<name>/ (engine.py =
the CV script, api.py = its endpoints); api.py now exposes an APIRouter instead
of its own FastAPI app, and this module mounts them all under a prefix. That
replaces the previous arrangement of seven separate services on ports 8001-8007.

WHY ONE PROCESS, beyond having one address to point a backend at: three features
(face recognition, emotion detection, wanted detection) all sit on InsightFace's
buffalo_s pack. As separate processes each loaded its own ~120MB copy; sharing
one interpreter means one copy, which is the difference between comfortable and
marginal on the Raspberry Pi 4 deployment target. Total CPU is unchanged -- the
same background loops run either way -- but memory drops sharply and there is
one lifecycle to manage instead of seven.

Route map (full detail in each feature's api.py docstring):

    GET  /                          this map, as JSON
    /cameras                        the site camera table (url, quality,
                                    which features watch each camera)
    GET  /frame?camera=|source=     one PNG frame (camera= applies its quality)
    GET  /video_meta?source=        {n_frames, fps, width, height}

    /calibration/...                homography per camera + multi-camera alignment
    /zoning/zones, /zoning/occupancy/stream
    /employee_activity/workstations, /employee_activity/status/stream
    /people/sources, /people/status, /people/tracks/stream
    /face/enroll, /face/faces, /face/scan
    /weapon/sources, /weapon/alerts/stream
    /fire/sources,   /fire/alerts/stream
    /emotion/sources,/emotion/alerts/stream
    /wanted/watchlist, /wanted/threshold, /wanted/sources, /wanted/alerts/stream

/frame and /video_meta live HERE rather than in each feature because they were
six byte-identical copies of the same eight lines; they are source-agnostic
utilities, not per-feature endpoints.

NO AUTHENTICATION, CORS WIDE OPEN. Every endpoint is open to anyone who can
reach the port -- a deliberate choice for an academic project, where the
per-feature X-API-Key scheme was more ceremony than it was worth. CORS is
allow_origins=["*"] for the same reason (needed for reference_ui/console/ and
any other browser frontend to call this from a different origin) -- it adds
no new risk on top of "no auth", since the API was already reachable from
anywhere that can hit the port. Before this is exposed to anything beyond a
trusted LAN it needs auth put back and CORS restricted together, and note
that two of these streams are more sensitive than the rest:
/wanted/alerts/stream broadcasts the names of people flagged as wanted (with
a photo of them attached), and /face + /wanted can both read out stored
biometric embeddings. Put this behind an authenticating reverse proxy with
TLS, or restore the API-key dependency, before real use.
