"""Deployable surface over tracker.py. Mounted at /employee_activity by the
unified app in features/main.py.

Answers "suivi du fonctionnement des employes" (from the product's 16-feature
roadmap) as presence-over-time at a named workstation, NOT face-identified
attendance (that's features/face_recognition + features/zoning composed by
the backend, a different feature: "presence des employes") and NOT
activity/idleness classification (researched and rejected as unreliable
everywhere it's been tried -- see tracker.py's docstring). This feature
never reads a face, so it works at whatever distance zoning's person
detector already handles, not face-recognition range.

A "workstation" is just a NAME bound to an EXISTING zoning zone -- create
the zone first via POST /zoning/zones (a pixel zone drawn on that desk's own
camera needs no calibration), then bind a workstation name to it here. No
detection runs in this module at all: it polls features/zoning's
already-computed occupancy (get_zone_count()) on its own background loop and
turns the count into a debounced present/away status per workstation -- see
tracker.py.

- POST      /employee_activity/workstations       -- {"name", "zone"} binds a
                                                      workstation to an
                                                      existing zoning zone.
- GET       /employee_activity/workstations         -- current status of
                                                      every registered
                                                      workstation.
- DELETE    /employee_activity/workstations/{name}
- WebSocket /employee_activity/status/stream        -- snapshot on connect,
                                                      then one update each
                                                      time a workstation's
                                                      status (present/away)
                                                      actually flips.

Each workstation's status is one of:
  "unknown" -- not yet classified (just registered, or zoning hasn't read
               that zone even once yet -- `zone_known: false` distinguishes
               "no data yet" from a genuine reading, same convention as
               zoning's own `people_tracking_ready`).
  "present" -- the zone had >= 1 person at the most recent poll (or has had
               one continuously since).
  "away"    -- the zone has been CONTINUOUSLY empty for
               >= employee_activity.absence_seconds.

Tunables live in features/config.json under "employee_activity":
poll_interval, absence_seconds (default 300s / 5 min -- a starting point,
not a measured one; see config.py). Workstation registrations persist at
features/data/employee_activity.json (see paths.py); the zones themselves
remain zoning's own data, untouched by this module.
