"""Deployable surface over engine.py, mounted at /people. Continuous person
tracking across every registered, calibrated, ALIGNED camera -- identities +
live floor positions, not headcount (see features/zoning for that). Unlike
every other feature here, this one has a real one-time SETUP cost (recovering
head homographies, person_scale and room extent -- ~30s wall-clock on a live
source, effectively instant on file sources) before it can track anything;
the background loop below manages that as an explicit state machine (idle ->
bootstrapping -> running / error) instead of assuming every cycle looks like
every other, the way zoning's per-cycle detection can.

                                            person's position changes almost
                                            every cycle by construction, so a

                                            while adding a float-jitter bug
                                            surface; update_interval already
                                            bounds the broadcast rate).

Bootstrap triggers AUTOMATICALLY once >=2 registered cameras are all
calibrated AND aligned (mirrors zoning's "runs once zone+source exist"
philosophy, and every other feature here starting its background work once
its own minimal precondition exists) -- there is deliberately no POST
/people/start; GET /people/status gives the observability an explicit
endpoint's response would have given anyway.

Gates (entry/exit points, an accuracy lever for low-quality/low-res footage
where detection noise is a bigger problem than it is on HD -- an unmatched
detection far from every marked gate is assumed to be an existing person
whose position estimate drifted, not someone genuinely new) are read fresh
from features/calibration's GATES file at every bootstrap, via
POST/DELETE /calibration/gates. No gates marked yet -> load_gates returns
[], and every gate-dependent branch in engine.Tracker.step is guarded by
`if gates:`/`if gates and ...`, so that degrades safely to "prior disabled,"
never an error.

The camera registry/calibration is read fresh every bootstrap (from
features/data/site_calibration.json, via features/calibration -- no changes
needed there, its output already matches the schema this engine reads).
person_scale/room/Hh are NOT persisted across a process restart -- a stale
scene geometry silently corrupting every downstream person-width threshold is
exactly the failure class this design exists to prevent, so a restart always
re-bootstraps fresh.

Tunables live in features/config.json under "person_tracking" -- see
config.py. The person detector (yolo11m_multi.pt) is shared with
features/zoning via common/person_detector.py -- one in-process model copy,
not two.
