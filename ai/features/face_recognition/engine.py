"""Face-recognition primitive -- enroll + identify -- the AI/CV script behind
this feature's API (features/face_recognition/api.py). features/<name>/ holds
only what's actually deployed: the CV script(s) + the endpoint(s) that expose
them, nothing else (no CLIs, no one-off validation scripts -- those live
elsewhere, see below).

Backed by InsightFace's "buffalo_s" pack by DEFAULT (SCRFD detector +
MobileFaceNet recognition, ~120MB, CPU-friendly via onnxruntime) -- same
reasoning as CLAUDE.md's yolov8n-nano choice: this project runs on CPU
everywhere (dev machine and the Raspberry Pi 4 deployment target), so pick
the smallest model that clears the accuracy bar, not the most accurate one
available. Accuracy validated against real labeled data (LFW pairs) in
evaluation/face_id_lfw_eval.py, not just "looks right" -- see that file for
the chosen similarity threshold's justification.

The pack is configurable (config.json's face.pack) precisely because that
CPU tradeoff stops applying once detection runs on a molab GPU instead --
see features/config.py's DEFAULTS for the buffalo_s vs buffalo_l tradeoff
and the cross-pack gallery-compatibility warning. Real, reported symptom
that motivated exposing this: buffalo_s missed real faces even up close
and head-on, not just distant/angled ones -- a genuine detector-capability
gap, not a resolution/det_size problem (see molab_notebook.py, which now
loads buffalo_l since compute there is effectively free).

Gallery format: JSON, {"people": {name: [[512 floats], ...]}} -- multiple
embeddings per person (multiple enrollment photos) improve robustness to
pose/lighting; identify() takes the best match over ALL of a person's stored
embeddings. Deliberately NOT tracked in git (see .gitignore) -- unlike zone
polygons or calibration numbers, this file is biometric data tied to named
real people.
