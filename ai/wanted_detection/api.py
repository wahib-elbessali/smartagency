"""Deployable surface over engine.py, mounted at /wanted by the unified app in
main.py. Continuous, always-on watchlist monitoring across whatever cameras are
registered -- same shape as weapon/fire/emotion detection, all built on
features/common/live_alert_service.py.

- POST      /wanted/watchlist          -- multipart name + photo, adds to the watchlist.
- GET       /wanted/watchlist           -- names + embedding counts. ?include_embeddings=true
                                           for the raw vectors (opt-in: dumping a wanted
                                           list's biometrics should be a deliberate act).
- DELETE    /wanted/watchlist/{name}    -- removes a person's ENTIRE watchlist entry.
- GET/PUT   /wanted/threshold           -- read / change the match threshold at runtime,
                                           effective on the next detection cycle, no restart.
- POST/GET  /wanted/sources, DELETE /wanted/sources/{camera}
- WebSocket /wanted/alerts/stream       -- pushed only when a camera's set of matched
                                           watchlist names changes.

THE ROUTES ARE DELIBERATELY NAMED DIFFERENTLY from features/face_recognition's
/enroll and /faces, even though the underlying gallery machinery is identical.
The catastrophic operator error this feature is shaped around is enrolling
someone into the WRONG list -- and `POST /face/enroll` vs `POST /wanted/watchlist`
cannot be confused for one another the way two identically-named routes could.
The galleries remain separate FILES too (wanted_gallery.json vs
face_gallery.json), so a delete on one provably cannot touch the other; note
that now the two run in ONE process, that file separation and the distinct route
names are the whole of the isolation -- there is no longer a process or port
boundary between them.

Tunables live in features/config.json under "wanted": threshold, min_face_px,
det_size, update_interval, confirm_cycles, hold_cycles. The threshold can also
be changed at RUNTIME via PUT /wanted/threshold, which takes effect on the next
detection cycle; that change is process-lifetime only, so config.json stays the
durable default. The watchlist itself is stored at a fixed location under
features/data/ -- see paths.py.
