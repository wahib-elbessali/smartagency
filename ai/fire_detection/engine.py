"""Fire/smoke-detection primitive -- the AI/CV script behind this feature's
API (features/fire_detection/api.py). Backed by a community-finetuned
YOLOv8n (luminous0219/fire-and-smoke-detection-yolov8 on GitHub) -- 2
classes: fire, smoke. Same "smallest model that clears the bar" reasoning
as every other detector in this project.

LICENSE NOTE: this specific weights file is distributed under AGPL-3.0 --
the strongest copyleft tier, whose network-use clause can obligate open-
sourcing the whole service that runs it, since this project exposes it
through a live API. Chosen deliberately over a much larger (31.8M param,
Apache-2.0) alternative that was likely too heavy for the Raspberry Pi 4 CPU
deployment target -- see weapon_fire_detection_built in project memory for
the full tradeoff discussion. Revisit this choice if the licensing
implication turns out to matter for how this project gets distributed/used.

Verified against real photos before being trusted: a real wildfire photo
(Wikimedia Commons) correctly triggered a "fire" detection at the default
settings. Smoke detection needed imgsz=1280 (not ultralytics' usual 640) to
reliably fire on a real smoke photo at a reasonable confidence -- confirmed
by testing both settings against the same real image, not assumed -- so
1280 is this module's default, not 640.

Model auto-downloads to models/fire_yolov8n.pt on first use (gitignored,
*.pt). NOTE: loading this specific checkpoint triggers ultralytics'
AutoInstall for the 'dill' package on first load in a fresh environment --
a real internet-access dependency at model-load time, worth knowing about
before deploying somewhere with restricted egress (pre-install `pip install
dill` to avoid needing it at load time).
