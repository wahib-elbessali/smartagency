/**
 * jsdom 26 implements <dialog> but not showModal() / close().
 *
 * Native <dialog> is deliberate in the app - it brings focus trapping, Escape
 * handling and inertness of the rest of the page, all of which are easy to get
 * wrong by hand and are what make a modal usable by keyboard. Dropping it to
 * suit the test environment would be the tail wagging the dog, so the two
 * missing methods are filled in here instead.
 *
 * This is a shim, not a reimplementation: it only tracks openness so components
 * can be rendered and queried. It does NOT emulate focus trapping, so tests
 * must not assert on that - a real browser is the only place to check it.
