/**
 * Holds session state, performs sign-in, and keeps the access token alive.
 *
 * Keeping it alive is the point of most of this file. Access tokens expire
 * after 30 minutes. Without a refresh, a wall-mounted dashboard silently stops
 * updating half an hour after someone signed it in, with no indication beyond
 * the panels going stale - which is the failure mode this whole screen was
 * designed to avoid.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, deliberately:
 *
 *   1. Proactive - a timer fires ahead of expiry so nothing ever 401s in normal
 *      operation. This is the one that should always win.
 *   2. Reactive - client.ts retries a 401 once after refreshing. Timers do not
 *      fire on a sleeping machine, and a dashboard that has been asleep is
 *      exactly the case where nobody is watching to fix it.
 *
 * Still no persistence. The token lives in memory (SECURITY.md), so a page
 * reload signs you out. Refresh extends a session; it does not survive one.
