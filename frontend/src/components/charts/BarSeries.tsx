/**
 * A single-series column chart: magnitude over an ordered axis.
 *
 * BUILT IN HTML, NOT SVG, and that is the interesting choice here. An SVG bar
 * chart has to either scale its viewBox - which stretches the corner radii and
 * the hairlines along with the bars - or measure its own container to lay out
 * in real pixels. Flex children sized in percentages dodge both: the radius
 * stays 4px and the gap stays 2px at every width, the bars are real DOM nodes
 * so hover and focus come from the browser, and there is no resize observer.
 *
 * ONE LIT BAR, THE REST MUTED. This is the pattern worth stealing from any good
 * dashboard: colouring every column identically means the chart answers "what
 * are the values" and nothing else, while muting all but one makes it answer
 * "which one matters", which is the question the viewer actually arrived with.
 * The lit colour sits outside the categorical lightness band deliberately - see
 * --color-data-lit in index.css.
 *
 * The value labels are NOT drawn on every bar. A number over each column is the
 * fastest way to turn a chart back into a table; the shape carries the
 * comparison and the tooltip carries the precision.
