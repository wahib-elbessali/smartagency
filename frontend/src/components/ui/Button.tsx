/**
 * Primary is the design's blue-to-cyan gradient with a white, bold label. On a
 * page of translucent glass it is the only saturated surface, which is what
 * makes it read as "press this" from across a room.
 *
 * The label is white rather than near-black: this blue is dark enough that
 * dark text on it would leave the primary action as the least readable thing
 * on the screen. See --gradient-accent in index.css for why the gradient's
 * ANGLE is load-bearing rather than decorative - it keeps the light cyan end
 * in a corner instead of under the text.
 *
 * Secondary is glass, one step denser than the cards. Against translucent
 * surfaces an outlined button reads as a gap rather than a control, so it
 * borrows the card treatment instead of drawing a border. Two visually
 * competing button styles side by side is the most common way a toolbar ends
 * up looking generated: everything shouts, so nothing leads.
