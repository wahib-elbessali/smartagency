/**
 * The styling of a form control, separated from Field's label/hint/error
 * wiring.
 *
 * In its own module rather than exported from Field.tsx for the reason the lint
 * rule gives: a file that exports both a component and a plain function breaks
 * Fast Refresh, so editing this string would stop hot-reloading every form that
 * uses it. `cn.ts` sits here for the same reason.
 *
 * Repeatable rows are what need it - a list of counters wants inputs that match
 * every other input on the dashboard but does NOT want a label, hint and error
 * slot above each one. Without this they get a hand-copied class string that
 * drifts the first time the focus ring changes.
