/**
 * The single card surface. Every boxed region on every screen is one of these,
 * so panels can't drift into slightly different greys and radii.
 *
 * A panel is GLASS, not a fill. Its surface is a diagonal gradient that fades
 * from nearly opaque to about half, over a heavy backdrop blur - so the page
 * shows through the far corner of every card as diffuse light.
 *
 * That is the whole look, and it is easy to lose. An opaque fill of the same
 * average colour produces a perfectly competent dark theme that resembles the
 * design not at all, because what the eye reads is not the colour but the
 * depth: a pane resting above the page rather than a hole cut into it. The
 * 20px radius is part of the same effect - tighten it and the pane goes back
 * to reading as a cut-out.
 *
 * No border. The design draws none, and on a translucent surface a hairline is
 * the one thing that would give away that this is a rectangle rather than
 * glass. The shadow does the separating instead: wide, far below, and very
 * faint, which is all a near-black page can carry.
