/**
 * The agency an admin is currently working inside, or null for all of them.
 *
 * THIS IS A VIEW FILTER, NOT A PERMISSION, and the difference matters enough to
 * say twice. An admin is entitled to every branch; this narrows what they are
 * looking at because they asked it to. A MANAGER's data arrives already scoped
 * by the backend and this does nothing for them - filtering their rows here
 * would be the frontend enforcing a boundary it does not own, which
 * api/endpoints/agencies.ts warns against in as many words.
 *
 * Because it is a lens rather than a rule, it has to be visible the entire time
 * it is on. An admin who forgets they are inside one branch and reads a total as
 * the whole estate is worse off than one who never had the control - hence the
 * bar in AppShell, which cannot be dismissed without leaving the branch.
 *
 * Memory only, like the session it hangs off: signing out or previewing another
 * role drops it.
