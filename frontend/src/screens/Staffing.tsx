/**
 * Whether the counters are being manned, live. Added 2026-09-19, the second
 * half of the AI/CV integration (contracts/ai-service.md
 * §/employee_activity).
 *
 * THIS IS NOT ATTENDANCE, and confusing the two would be the expensive
 * mistake. Employee presence answers "did they badge in today?" from the RFID
 * reader at the door. This answers "is anyone at counter 3 right now, while
 * twelve people are waiting?" Somebody can be present by the first measure
 * and away by the second all afternoon, and both readings are true.
 *
 * HOW LITTLE IS BEHIND IT
 *
 * No face recognition, no new model, no calibration: the AI service builds
 * this entirely on /zoning's existing occupancy. A workstation is a name
 * bound to a zone drawn on the Zones screen - so that screen is the setup
 * step for this one, which is why the empty state sends people there.
 *
 * THE THREE STATUSES ARE NOT TWO
 *
 * `present` fires on any sighting. `away` arrives only after the zone has
 * been continuously empty for the service's absence window (300s by
 * default), so it is a slow and deliberate signal rather than a flicker -
 * stepping to the printer does not empty a counter. `unknown` is neither: it
 * means the zone has not been classified yet, and with `zone_known: false`
 * it means nothing has EVER been read there, which is a broken camera rather
 * than a quiet counter. Those are rendered as three different things,
 * because a screen that shows "away" for a camera that has never worked is
 * reporting an unmanned counter that may be perfectly staffed.
 *
 * ROWS COME FROM REST, STATUS COMES FROM THE STREAM
 *
 * The list is the scoped one - the proxy filters it to the caller's branch
 * through the zone's camera, since the AI service has no notion of an agency
 * and its stream carries the whole site. So the stream is used to refresh
 * the status of rows this caller already has, and a frame naming a
 * workstation that is not in their list is ignored rather than rendered.
 * Without that, one manager's wall display would quietly grow another
 * branch's counters.

 * declares `away` AFTER the full absence window has already elapsed, so the
