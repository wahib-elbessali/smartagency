/**
 * Every test here signs in as an ADMIN, because that is the only role this
 * screen can be reached with: the whole /api/users router is ADMIN-only.
 *
 * It used to sign in through the provider, which meant a MANAGER - the role the
 * login fixture hands out on the default scenario - and the suite passed
 * because the fixtures answered anyone. They enforce roles now (mocks/roles.ts),
 * so testing this screen as a manager would only ever assert the refusal state,
 * which is its own test at the bottom of this file.
 *
 * The session is supplied two ways at once and needs both: SessionContext is
 * what the component reads for "(you)" and for the role locks, and tokenStore
 * is what the fixtures read to decide whether the request is allowed - the
 * stand-in for the bearer token the backend would authorise against.
