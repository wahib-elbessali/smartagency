/**
 * A NOTE ON WHY NOTHING HERE SAYS `expect(await findByText(x)).toBeInTheDocument()`.
 *
 * Each scripted feed emits three frames roughly 20ms apart: an empty snapshot,
 * an update carrying the detection, then an update clearing it again. So every
 * interesting string in this file exists for about twenty milliseconds and is
 * then removed on purpose - the all-clear is part of what these fixtures model.
 *
 * `findByText` resolves the instant the node appears. Chaining an assertion
 * onto the resolved node evaluates it one tick later, by which point the
 * clearing frame may already have detached it - and the test fails with
 * "element could not be found in the document" after ~90ms rather than timing
 * out, which reads like the screen never rendered it at all.
 *
 * So: let the `find` be the assertion, since it throws when nothing turns up,
 * and group anything that must hold at the SAME moment into one `waitFor` so
 * the whole group is retried against a single consistent DOM.
