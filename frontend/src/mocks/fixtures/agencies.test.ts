/**
 * A MANAGER sees one branch: their own.
 *
 * Tested at the fixture rather than through a screen because the screen is not
 * where the rule lives, and must not be - a MANAGER's list arrives already
 * filtered from the backend and filtering it again in a component would take
 * rows away from an ADMIN who is entitled to them. This layer stands in for the
 * backend, so this is where the filter belongs and where it is worth pinning.
 *
 * It was missing here for long enough to be reported from testing: on fixtures
 * a manager saw both branches, including an Edit button that PUT /api/agencies
 * answers with 403 "Acces limite a votre agence".
