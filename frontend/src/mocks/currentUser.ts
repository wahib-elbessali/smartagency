 * Who is making the request, in mock mode.
 *
 * Until now nothing outside the auth fixtures could read this, so every other
 * fixture answered as though an ADMIN were asking. That is wrong in the
 * direction the mock layer explicitly refuses to be wrong in (userStore.ts):
 * the default scenario signs you in as a MANAGER, and a MANAGER's reads are
 * scoped server-side. Handing them rows the real API filters out lets a screen
 * be built against a list that cannot happen.
 *
 * Kept in its own module rather than exported from fixtures/auth.ts, because
 * that file registers mocks as a module side effect and a store importing it
 * would drag the auth endpoints along with it.
