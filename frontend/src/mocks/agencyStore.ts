/**
 * A writable agency list for mock mode.
 *
 * Same reasoning as the employee store: a screen whose purpose is creating and
 * editing cannot be built against a frozen fixture, because the create appears
 * to succeed and the list never changes - which reads as a bug in the screen
 * rather than a limit of the fixtures.
 *
 * It also enforces the rules the backend enforces. Every refusal here is one
 * the contract documents, with the same status code, so the form is exercised
 * against its real failure modes long before there is a server to talk to:
 *
 *   409  two counters in one request sharing a `number`
 *   422  a name outside 2-150 characters
 *   404  an id that does not exist
