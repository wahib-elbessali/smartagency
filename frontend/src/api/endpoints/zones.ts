/**
 * Detection zones — PROPOSED, not in contracts/api.md (2026-09-19).
 *
 * These are the polygons the AI service counts people inside
 * (contracts/ai-service.md §/zoning). They are NOT `Agency.zones`; see the
 * comment on `CameraZone` in api/types.ts for why two unrelated things share
 * the word, and BACKEND-ASKS.md §8d for the question that has to be settled.
 *
 * WHY THESE GO THROUGH THE BACKEND
 *
 * ai/reference_ui/console calls the AI service's /zoning routes directly and
 * that is fine for a local test page - the service runs allow_origins=["*"]
 * with no authentication at all. This dashboard cannot: decided 2026-08-11
 * (repo CLAUDE.md), and it matters more here than for the read-only alert
 * streams, because these are WRITES that reconfigure the site's geometry.
 * Re-posting an existing name silently replaces that zone, mode included.
 *
 * So all three are proxies the backend has to write, mapping our camera UUID
 * to the camera name the AI service knows it by - the same mapping
 * app/ai_alerts/consumer.py already performs when it registers sources.
 * Until they exist a real backend answers 404 and the screen says the
 * detector is not reachable; on fixtures they work end to end.
 *
 * Roles: ADMIN and MANAGER, scoped to the caller's own agency through the
 * camera each zone hangs off. Not SECURITY - registering cameras and moving
 * the alert threshold is theirs (contracts/api.md §11-12), but the floor
 * geometry the counts are computed from is a different kind of act. Worth
 * confirming with backend rather than assuming.
 */

/**
 * Every zone the caller may see, camera by camera.
 *
 * The AI service answers with a name-keyed map; this expects the backend to
 * hand back a list with the name inside each entry, because a list is what
 * every other route here returns and the name is already the key inside it.
