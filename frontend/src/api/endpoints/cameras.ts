/**
 * PROPOSED - not in contracts/api.md (2026-09-12). The current picture from
 * one camera, as image bytes.
 *
 * The AI service already serves this as GET /frame?camera=<id>&format=jpeg
 * &quality=<1-100> (contracts/ai-service.md, App-level) - a still frame at the
 * resolution the detectors see, so boxes from the alert stream line up on it.
 * The browser must not call that service (CLAUDE.md, decided 2026-08-11), so
 * this is the route to ask backend for: authenticate, look the camera up by
 * our id, forward to the AI service by the name it knows the camera as, and
 * pass the bytes back with the AI service's own status:
 *
 *   GET /api/cameras/{camera_id}/frame?format=jpeg&quality=75
 *   -> 200 image/jpeg
 *   -> 404 when the camera does not exist, or the AI service cannot open its
 *      stream (the same 404 it answers itself)
 *
 * Same roles and agency scoping as the camera. Against a backend without it
 * the screen shows "no picture" and keeps the detections - the boxes are
 * still true, they just have nothing to sit on.

/**
 * The same picture at the camera's NATIVE resolution, for calibration.
 *
 * Kept as its own function rather than a flag, because the two callers want
 * opposite things and silently getting the other one is not visible on
 * screen. `fetchCameraFrame` above returns the detector-scaled frame, so
 * alert boxes land in the right place. This one must not be scaled: the 4
 * clicked points are sent with `img_w`/`img_h`, the service uses the image
 * centre as an assumed principal point, and points measured on a resized
 * frame describe a camera that does not exist.
 *
 * PROPOSED alongside the frame proxy itself - BACKEND-ASKS.md §8c asks for
 * the two cases to stay distinguishable, whatever the parameter ends up
 * being called.
