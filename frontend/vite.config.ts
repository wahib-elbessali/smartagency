     nothing about production.

     It exists because backend/app/main.py installs no CORS middleware, so a
     browser on :5173 calling :8000 is blocked before the request is even sent.
     Proxying through the dev server makes every call same-origin, which is the
     usual fix and needs no backend change. Point VITE_API_BASE_URL at the dev
     server itself (http://localhost:5173) and the rest of the API layer is
     unchanged.

     ws: true matters - WS /ws/attendance is a protocol upgrade, and without it
     the proxy would answer the handshake with plain HTTP. */

       whatever a developer happens to have configured for local development.
       Point .env.local at a real backend - which is exactly what you do to work
       against one - and the suite starts failing: VITE_USE_MOCKS=false stops
       the fixtures serving, and VITE_AUTH_ENFORCED=true makes the route guard
       redirect in a test asserting it stays inert.
    
       These are the defaults from .env.example, so the suite tests the state a
       fresh clone is in. Individual tests still override with vi.stubEnv, and
       vi.unstubAllEnvs restores to these rather than to someone's .env.local. */
